# Footsnip #

Footsnip is a Java game engine that myself and Dave Payne wrote a couple of years back as an educational experience. It's probably not in a viable state. May work. .gitignore looks ropey, so there's a lot of crap included. Uses LWJGL, JBullet. Possibly some missing attributions; sorry.
